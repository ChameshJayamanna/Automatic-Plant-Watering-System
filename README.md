# Automatic Plant Watering System 

An fully automated line following robot that will supply water to the plant according to the moisture level of the soil.

## INFO

In This Plant Watering System, Soil Moisture Sensor checks the moisture level in the soil and if moisture level is low 
then Arduino switches on a water pump to provide water to the plant.
Water pump gets automatically off when system finds enough
moisture in the soil. Whenever system switched on or off the pump, a
message is sent to the user via GSM module, updating the status of
water pump and soil moisture.

## CODE

Automated plant watering system is programmed using Arduino IDE
